\section{Specific Comments to the Position Application}

\item \textbf{Solid background on the numerical analysis and scientific computing:} Starting in my undergraduate studies but further developed during my Masters and PhD period, numerical analysis and scientific computing have always been the core of my coursework.}

\item \textbf{Good coding skills:} I start programming since the first day of University (literally). Firstly, I learned C/C++, including object-orientation paradigm. Secondly, I was introduced to more high level languages such as Matlab and Python, the latter being my preferable choice now. Later on, during my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to sharpen my skills taking more advanced courses on computer science (see coursework on the left panel). Finally, during my Masters and PhD project, I developed in-house finite element solvers using modern Fortran (core) and Python (as configuration language).  
\item \textbf{Solid mechanics expertise:} Having a background in Mechanical Engineering, I have studied the broad range of theories in mechanics, but specially Nonlinear Solid Mechanics (in both geometrical and constitutive sense) has been the topic of my utmost interest. This is the main reason why of the expertise chosen at ENSAM and also guided me in my Masters and PhD projects (both at LNCC). In these latter, I studied soft tissues in cardiovascular solid mechanics. 
\item \textbf{Machine Learning:} Since middle of last year, when I have read Oishi, A. and Ayagawa, G. (2017) \textit{Computational mechanics enhanced by deep learning}, CMAME, I became interested to ML. It was the first time that I realised the wide range of applications of ML to my current research field, which is computational mechanics/scientific computing. Since I finished my PhD project (April 2019), I took an online course at AI (from COPPE/UFRJ, Brazil) and now I am attending to an introductory ML course at LNCC, both at graduate level.

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
